- 👋 Hi, I’m @sashperso
- 👀 I’m interested in containerisation, Linux distros, Ansible automation, and DevOps!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to leverage containers through OpenShift
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on DevOps practices and repositories, and get my hands dirty with RHOCP!
- 📫 If you want to reach me, shoot me an email at spersone@redhat.com :-)
